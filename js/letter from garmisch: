letter from garmisch:
sitting in the hotel after a day full of skiing and a few pints at the pub. the slopes were way more icy than at home, but the total sum of the runs were a lot longer. multiple chair lifts to get to the top. I'll forward pictures once I get them from my cousin. early to bed tonight in hopes that we can take the train up to zugspitze tomorrow.
